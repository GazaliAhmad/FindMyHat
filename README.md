A class assessment project to Find my Hat.

Tech Stack
* JavaScript

This was my JavaScript assessment. The requirements were to:
* Create a playing field
* A '*' represents the character
* Randomly populate the fields with holes 'o' and a hat '^'
* Using the classic game keys, "wsad" : Movement is w (up), s (down), a (left) & d (right)
* Check if character goes over the field -> game ends
* Check if character goes into hole -> game ends
* Check if character gets the hat -> win
